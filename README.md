Simple projects that I worked on

## Number Base Converter

baseConv.py:

Ask the user to input a decimal number, convert it to binary/octal/hexadecimal, and vice-versa.

When converting non-decimal numbers, prefixes should be added (0b, 0o, 0x).

To-do list:

⬜️Print the result without prefixes.

## List Prime Numbers from a Given Range of Numbers

Determine a range by asking the user to input a "starting number" and a "ending number".

List all prime numbers in that range (optional).

Show the number of primes and their percentage in that range.
